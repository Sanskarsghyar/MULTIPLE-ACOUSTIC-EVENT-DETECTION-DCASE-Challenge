### Course Project | Supervisor:- Dr. Vipul Arora â€“ EE603A (Machine Learning for Signal Processing)

- Transformed audio dataset into Melspectrogram representations, enhancing feature extraction for accurate audio tagging
- Implemented Multi-label Classification CNN model achieving 82.2% accuracy to predict the audio among 10 events
- Conducted performance evaluation, revealing that CNN architecture is superior for sound classification than ANN
